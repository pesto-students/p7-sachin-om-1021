----- code ----- 

function createIncrement() {
  let count = 0;
  function increment() {
    count++;
  }

  let message = `count is ${count}`;
  
  function log() {
    console.log(message);
  }

  return [increment, log];
}

const [increment, log] = createIncrement();

increment();
increment();
increment();
log();

----- output -----

 count is 0


----- explanation ----- 

In the output the value of count is zero becauese everytime the increment
function is called it updates the balue of count but the value is not reassigned
to the message variable it holds the initial value that was assigned when tha function 
was executed for the very first time thus the value of count reamains zero during the 
entire execution and never gets updated.Message variable is independent of the incerement 
function and increment function doesnt affects the value store in message.
